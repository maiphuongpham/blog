## Self Introduction
I am Mai Pham. I come from Vietnam and I lived there for 22 years. I have a bachelor's degree in International Business Management and some industry experience in banking and accounting, both in Vietnam and the US, before I went to Columbia to pursue my dream, to learn and leverage an analytical and technological approach in various management problems, which is why I'm here, as a first-year Master's student in Operations Research.

My most concentrated application is Finance - as I'm a CFA level 2 candidate. However, I'm eager to participate in any interdisciplinary projects that could improve my research skills. I'm interested in Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, which can be employed to solve, for example, sentiment analysis (CNN-LSTM), topic modeling (LDA) could be used to analyze social media contents or behaviours, which is helpful in prediction. On the other hands, I'm also thinking of researching on online learning, for example, online allocation to optimize healthcare supply chain management in real-time. With those analytical tools, we can then implement in multiple problems, for example, in women's public health.

As a women, I'm inclined to explore the potential health risk of myself, and of course many others.
## Expectation
Clearly, when I apply to SummerOverSEAS, I'm expected to acquire research experience. I'll try to apply to a PhD this year. I truly appreciate this experience, because it'll bring me closer to my dream. I'll take this chance to learn how to select reference papers and sources of data, how to write  manuscripts etc.

## Questions
The only concern I have with the program is about stipends. I'm currently on an F-2 visa - which prohibits me from working in the US. However, I'm happy to participate in the program voluntarily.

## Most recent job

I wouldn't talk about the most recent one, which is a business accountant intern - but I think the more remarkable one is my most recent research job. I researched at a CS lab at Thuy Loi university under the supervision of Prof. Quang Chieu Ta. He's also helped me get exposed to the world of Data Science and of course AI. The collaboration with the lab was comfortable where my primary task was researching, processing and analyzing data. The most recent project was "Prediction of flood and water level in Quang Binh’s river systems” using machine learning to return a
real-time predictive visualized product.

The first reason is I'm passionate about research in general.
