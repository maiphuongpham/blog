### Analysis of Financial Institutions
#### Liquidity coverage ratio 
$$LCR = \frac{\text{highly liquid assets}}{\text{expected cash outflows}}$$
#### Net stable funding ratio
$$NSFR = \frac{\text{available stable funding}}{\text{required stable funding}}$$
#### Insurance Company Key Ratios
$$\text{Underwriting loss ratio} = \frac{\text{claims paid} + \Delta \text{loss reserves}}{\text{net premium earned}}$$
$$\text{Expense ratio} = \frac{\text{underwriting expenses incl. commissions}}{net premium written}$$
$$\text{Loss and loss adjustment expense ratio} = \text{net premium earned}$$
$$\text{Dividends ratio} = \frac{\text{dividends}}{net premiums earned}$$
