International parity is a framework for developing a view about futre exchange rate movements. Parity Relations the inter-relatioships that jointly determine long-run movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and inflation. Parity conditions show how expected inflation differentials ($\pi$), interest rate differentials ($i$), forward foreign exchange (Fx) rates ($F$), current spot Fx rates ($S$), and expected future spot foreign exchange rates would be linked in an ideal world ($S^{e}$).

Empirical studies showed that international parity conditions rarely hold in either the short or medium term (except covered interest rate parity). Further, forward Fx rates have been found to be poor predictors of future spot Fx rates.

# Interest Rate Parity

Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition representing an equilibrium state under which investors interest rates available on bank deposits in two contries

## Covered Interest Rate Parity
Covered interest rate parity describes a riskless, arbitrage relationship. It is supported where capital is permitted to flow freely, spot and forward Fx markets are liquid, financial market conditions are basically stress-free.

Formally, covered interest rate parity requires that (given f/d quote structure):

$$ F = \frac{1 + i_{f}}{1 + i_{d}} S_{0} $$

## Uncovered Interest Rate Parity
Uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) states that expected return on an uncovered (unhedged) foreign currency investment should equal the return on a comparable domestic currency investment. The following equation represents uncovered interest rate parity (given f/d quote structure):

$$ E(\Delta S  / S_{t}) = i_{f} - i_{d}$$

Under UIRP, country with higher interst rate is expected to see the value of its currency depreciate.

If UIRP held, no excess return could be gained by going long a high-yielding currency or short a low-yielding one, no incentive to shift capital from one currency to another.

Empirical studies showed UIRP failed to hold over short and medium terms. Interest rate diffentials are generally a poor predictor of future Fx rate changes; high-yield currencies tend to strengthen, not weaken; forward Fx rates are a poor predictor of future spot Fx rates; current spot Fx rates are also poor predictors of future spot Fx rates.

# Purchasing Power Parity

## (Absolute) Purchasing Power Parity

Purchasing power parity (PPP) compares the average price of a representative basket of consumption goods between countries. PPP is based on 'law of one price' (identical goods should trade at the same price across countries when valued in terms of a common currency)

$$S_{f/d} = \frac{\text{CPI}_{f}}{\text{CPI}_{d}}$$

Recall: $\text{CPI} = \frac{\text{market basket of desired year}}{\text{market basket of base year}} \times 100$

In practice, even if the law of one price held for every good in two economies, absolute PPP might not hold because the weights (consumption patterns) of goods are different.

## Relative Purchasing Power Parity

Relative purchasing power parity (relative PPP) states that changes in Fx rates should exactly offset the price effects of any inflation differential between two countries.

$$\% \Delta S_{f/d} = \pi_{f} - \pi_{d}$$

## Ex-ante PPP

$$\% \Delta S_{f/d}^{e} = \pi_{f}^{e} - \pi_{f}^{e}$$

# The Fisher effect and Real Interest Rate Parity

When both UIRP and (ex-ante) PPP hold, the two conditions together reveal a relationship among expected real interest rates, which is known as real interest rate parity (RIRP) and is related to the international Fisher effect.

$$\text{UIRP}: E( \Delta S_{t+k} / S_{t}) = i_{f} - i_{d}$$

$$\text{Ex-ante PPP}: E(\Delta S_{t+k} / S_{t}) = \pi_{f}^{e} - \pi_{d}^{e}$$

$$\text{RIRP}: i_{f} - i_{d} = \pi_{f}^{e} - \pi_{d}^{e}$$

Note: 
Since $i = r + \pi^{e}$, RIRP implies real yield spread $(r_{f} - r_{d}) = 0$

IMF Consultative Group on Exchange Rate Issues
1. Macroeconomic balance approach: estimates how much Fx rates need to adjust in order to close the gap between the medium-term expectation for a country's current account imbalance and that country's normal (or sustainable) current account imbalance (focus on 'real' flows - current account)

2. External sustainability approach: focuses on stocks of outstanding assets or debt, how much Fx rates need to adjust to ensure that a country's net foreign asset/GDP ratio or net foreign liability/GDP ratio stabilizes at some benchmark level (focus on 'financial' flows - capital account)

3. A reduced form econometric model: seeks to estimate the equilibrium path that a currency should take on the basis of the trends in several key macro variables.

Relationship between PPP currency values and current account states;

1. overvalued currency, trade surplus (X > M): unclear
2. overvalued currency, trade deficit (X < M): encourage depreciation
3. undervalued currency, trade surplus (X > M): encourage appreciation
4. undervalued currency, trade deficit (X < M): unclear
