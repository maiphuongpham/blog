International parity is a framework for developing a view about futre exchange rate movements. Parity Relations the inter-relatioships that jointly determine long-run movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and inflation. Parity conditions show how expected inflation differentials ($\pi$), interest rate differentials ($i$), forward foreign exchange (Fx) rates ($F$), current spot Fx rates ($S$), and expected future spot foreign exchange rates would be linked in an ideal world ($S^{e}$).

Empirical studies showed that international parity conditions rarely hold in either the short or medium term (except covered interest rate parity). Further, forward Fx rates have been found to be poor predictors of future spot Fx rates.

# Interest Rate Parity

Interest rate parity is a no-arbitrage condition representing an equilibrium state under which investors interest rates available on bank deposits in two contries

## Covered Interest Rate Parity
Covered interest rate parity describes a riskless, arbitrage relationship. It is supported where capital is permitted to flow freely, spot and forward Fx markets are liquid, financial market conditions are basically stress-free.

Formally, covered interest rate parity requires that (given f/d quote structure):

$$ F = \frac{1 + i_{f}}{1 + i_{d}} S_{0} $$

## Uncovered Interest Rate Parity
Uncovered interest rate parity (UIRP) states that expected return on an uncovered (unhedged) foreign currency investment should equal the return on a comparable domestic currency investment. The following equation represents uncovered interest rate parity (given f/d quote structure):

$$ E(\% \Delta S) = i_{f} - i_{d}$$

Under UIRP, country with higher interst rate is expected to see the value of its currency depreciate.

If UIRP held, no excess return could be gained by going long a high-yielding currency or short a low-yielding one, no incentive to shift capital from one currency to another.

Empirical studies showed UIRP failed to hold over short and medium terms. Interest rate diffentials are generally a poor predictor of future Fx rate changes; high-yield currencies tend to strengthen, not weaken; forward Fx rates are a poor predictor of future spot Fx rates; current spot Fx rates are also poor predictors of future spot Fx rates.
