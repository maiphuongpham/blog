# Supervised Machine Learning algorithms

## Penalized Regression

(Dimention Reduction)

$$\min \sun_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_{i}^{2} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{k} |\hat{b_{k}}|$$

where $|\hat{b_{k}}|$ is the number of included features.

## Support Vector Machine

(Classification, Regression and Outlier Detection)

Maximize the probability of making a correct prediction by determining the (linear) boundary that is furthest from all observations.

Trade-off between a wider margin and a lower total error penalty.

## K-nearest Neighbour

(Classification (sometimes regression))

Classify new observations by finding similarities in the existing data.

Sensitive to irrelevant and correlated features.

## Classification and Regression Trees (CART)

## Ensemble Learning and Random Forests

# Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms

## Principal Components Analysis

(Dimention Reduction)

## Clustering

### K-mean clustering

### Hieracrchical clustering

# Deep Learning
## Neural Networks

(Classification, Regression supervised learning)

## Deep Learning Nets

Neural networks with many hidden layers (at least 3, typically >20)

(image, pattern, speech recognition)

## Reinforcement Learning

(unsupervised)
