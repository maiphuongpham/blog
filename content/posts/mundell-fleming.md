# Mundell-Fleming Model

Developed in early 1960s, the Mundell-Fleming model evaluates the short-term impact of monetary and fiscal policies on interest rates - and consequently on exchange rates. The model assumes that there is sufficient slack in the economy to handle changes in aggregate demand, and that inflation is not a concern.

## Flexible Exchange Rate Regimes
Rates are determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets.
**High mobility of capital:** international capital flows are relatively _unrestricted_.

|           | + Monetary | - Monetary |
| ----------------------------------- |
|+ Fiscal   | ?          | appreciates|
|- Fiscal   | depreciates| ?          |

Expansionary monetary policy: raises interest rates, reduces capital inflows (financial account), reduces demand for domestic currency, depreciation.

Expansionary fiscal policy: increases deficit (lower tax, higher spending), increases government borrowing, increases interest rates, increases demand for domestic currency, appreciation.

**Low mobility of capital:** international capital flows are relatively _restricted_.

|           | + Monetary | - Monetary |
| ----------------------------------- |
|+ Fiscal   | depreciates| ?          |
|- Fiscal   | ?          | appreciates|

impact of trade imbalance on exchange rates (good flow effect) is greater than the impact of interest rates (financial flows effect). Expansionary fiscal or monetary policy increases net import, leading to depreciation of the domestic currency.

## Fixed Exchange Rate Regimes

Expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy leads to depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency. Then the government has to purchase (sell) its own currency, reversing the expansionary (restrictive) stance.

# Monetary Approach
Monetary models only take into account the effect of monetary policy on exchange rates (fiscal policy effects are not considered).

We assume that output is fixed, so that monetary polict primarily affects inflation, which in turn affects exchange rates.

Pure Monetary Model: PPP holds at any point, output is held constant. An expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy leads to an increase (decrease) in prices and a decrease (increase) in the value of the domestic currency.

Dornbusch Overshooting Model: assumes that prices are sticky (inflexible) in the short term, hence, do not immediately reflect changes in monetary policy (PPP does not hold in the short term). Exchange rates will overshoot the long-run PPP value in the short term. Expansionary monetary policy leads to price increase over time, decrease in interest rates, 

# Portfolio Balance approaches

The portfolio balance approach takes a long-term view and evaluates the effects of a sustained fiscal deficit or surplus on currency values.
