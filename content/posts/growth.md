# Classical Growth Theory

The conceptual foundations were formed by Thomas Malthus.

Malthusianism is the idea that population growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a population die off.

Technological progress causes lrger population growth but had no impact on income per capita in the long run.

# Neoclassical Growth Theory

Neoclassical growth theory (Solow growth model) focus on estimating the economy's long-term **steady state growth rate**.

Based on the Cobb-Douglas function
$$Y = TK^{\alpha} L^{1 - \alpha}$$

$$\text{Output per worker} = Y/L = T(K/L)^{\alpha}$$

Sustainable growth of output per capita: $g* = \frac{\theta}{a - \alpha}$

Sustainable growth rate of output: $G* = \frac{\theta}{1 - \alpha} + \Delta L$
