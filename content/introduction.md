## Mai Pham
I am a student that currently enroll at Columbia Engineering majoring in Operations Research.
The more I've grown, the more I've learned that education is my priority. I started my education at Foreign Trade University where I was involved with Corporate Finance. As I graduated, I was exposed to some programming languages. This experience opened my mind to many research and collaboration opportunities within Financial Engineering and Operations Research. I've worked hard from that moment on to prepare myself in every way to be qualified for the rigorous challenges that higher education entails, and I also humbly seek share the gift of learning to inspire others on their own paths of discovery and self-improvement.

Since embarking on my educational journey, this realization has shaped my perspective: *"The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know" (Albert Einstein)*
