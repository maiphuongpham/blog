## Biography

I am a student in Operations Research at Columbia Engineering. As far as I progressed, I've learned that education is my priority. My education stepped from Business Administration to Operations Research and Data Science.

As I graduated from Foreign Trade University in Vietnam, besides taking a few graduate entry positions in the industry for two years, fortunately, I had the opportunity to work with the kind-hearted and brilliant professors at the Department of Artificial Intelligence, ThuyLoi University, and delved into the world of engineering. This experience opened my mind to many research and collaboration opportunities within Operations Research and Financial Engineering. I've worked to prepare myself in every way to be qualified for the rigorous challenges that higher education entails, and through this website, I also humbly seek share the gift of learning to inspire others on their own paths of discovery and self-improvement.

Since embarking on my learning journey, this realization has shaped my perspective: 
> *"The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know" (Albert Einstein)*

## Academic Work
### Publications
1. P. M. Pham and Q. C. Ta, “Stacked Long Short-Term Memory for Vietnamese Stock Market Returns Prediction”, IJASCFRT, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 193–208, May 2022. [pdf](https://ijascfrtjournal.isrra.org/index.php/Applied_Sciences_Journal/article/view/1237/68)

> This independent project served as an my introductionto the field of data science, especially in the context of computational finance. Under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Ta, the Head of Artificial Intelligence Department at ThuyLoi University (VietNam), I explored the time-series data, which has long been recognized for their deviations from traditional econometric assumptions and requirement for specialized techniques and considerations. In the paper, I briefly discussed the overview of autoregressive methods (ARIMA, SARIMA) and proposed a Stacked  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  neural  network to predict the return of VN-Index, which demonstrated outperformance to statistical models in the prediction task.

2. Q. C. Ta and P. M. Pham, “Integrated Flow Shop and Vehicle Routing Problem Based on Tabu Search Algorithm”, IJC, vol. 43, no. 1, pp. 24–35, Apr. 2022 . [pdf](https://ijcjournal.org/index.php/InternationalJournalOfComputer/article/view/1927/714)

> This was Dr. Ta's project and my contribution was insignificant, but it was a pivotal catalyst, propelling me to the world of Operations Research. Flow shop scheduling and vehicle routing problem is a widely studied and prominent problem in operations research. We considered a m-machine flow shop scheduling problem with one vehicle available. The manufacturing workshop is a flow shop and there is only one vehicle available. Our objective was to minimize total tardiness while dealing with three interdependent problems: scheduling the jobs in the flow shop environment, batching the completed jobs, and routing the batches. We presented the resolution method based on Tabu search algorithm. Computational experiments were performed on random data sets and showed the efficiency of the methods.

### Theses
1. "Impact of Institutional Ownership on Earnings Management in Vietnamese Enterprises", thesis, 2021. [pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348406146_ANH_HUONG_CUA_SO_HUU_TO_CHUC_DEN_HOAT_DONG_QUAN_TRI_LOI_NHUAN_TAI_CAC_DOANH_NGHIEP_VIET_NAM#fullTextFileContent)

> 104-page graduation thesis from Foreign Trade University, written in Vietnamese, specifically focusing on the field of Corporate Finance using statistical models. Under the guidance of Dr. Nguyen, it achieved the second highest grade among more than 300 students in my faculty. The thesis conducted a comprehensive review of previous studies on Earnings Management and Institutional Ownership and then centering on the analysis of panel data using three statistical models: Ordinary Least Squares Model, Fixed Effect Model, and Random Effect Model. The variables examined included leverage, market-to-book ratio, profitability, firm size, growth rate, company's age, market share, and institutional ownership. Earnings management was assessed using discretionary accruals estimated with the contemporary statistical estimation technique proposed by Kоthаri et al (2005).

### Projects

1. "A QPLEX Model for Electric Vehicle Battery Swapping Services", 2023. [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oEXUlFG2WP7Hmk_Pbbwp61Y4jS6ggEwO/view?usp=sharing)

> According to Wei et al.(2023), there is a trend of “swap-locally, charge-centrally” ideas in the field of battery swapping. However, transporting them in a scale of houndrands daily would be a logistical challenge. We propose a new framework of combining existing battery swap stations and the idea of “charge-centrally”. In our framework, instead of totally relying on the charging station, the swap station will have the same capability as existing swap stations in terms of charging the battery locally, however, they can order a truck of fully charged batteries from the centralized charging station if their inventory is low. In this way, we hope to combine the advantages of both systems. This project leverages QPLEX methodology (Dieker & Hackman) - a nonstationary, nonparametric, non-Markovian modeling and analysis paradigm for stochastic networks.

2. "Resource Allocation on Live-Streaming Video Platforms", 2023. [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YIa5EnmoUoBnljf9RGfezTwGEkX0EdGr/view?usp=sharing)

> This project addresses the challenge of optimizing resource allocation on live-streaming video platforms. The focus is on solving the problem of efficiently distributing server resources amidst the dynamically changing demand of users, ensuring both high-quality streaming experience and cost-effectiveness. It proposed an approach that combined Machine Learning-Deep Q-Learning (ML-DQL) as in RL-OPRA (Baccour et al, 2020), with extensions in Double Deep Q-Network (Double DQN) and and Count-based Exploration DQN. The findings demonstrate significant improvements in resource utilization compared to the greedy benchmark, offering valuable insights for managing complex, user-driven live-streaming environments.

3. "Central Bank Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models", 2023. [pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1A3bdgLPMtC_h3gmdj3zoFN5lLBZ0P1xf/view?usp=sharing)

> Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statements are vital indicators of changes in monetary policy. The classification of FOMC sentiments into hawkish, dovish, or neutral has been approached through various methods, including unsupervised and dictionary-based models, and machine learning models. Recently developed large language models (LLMs) have showcased superior proficiency across various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. These extend beyond text generation - such as chat interactions, text summarization, question answering, problem solving - to text classification, notably sentiment analysis. This project aimed at exploring the capacities of LLMs to classify FOMC statements into hawkish, dovish, or neutral, then proposed the most efficient method to achieve this classification at both sentence and document levels.
