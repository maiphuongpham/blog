## Biography

I am a student in Operations Research at Columbia Engineering. As far as I progressed, I've learned that education is my priority. My education spans from Business Administration to Operations Research and Data Science.

As I graduated from Foreign Trade University in Vietnam, I had the opportunity to delve into some programming languages. This experience opened my mind to many research and collaboration opportunities within Operations Research and Financial Engineering. I've worked hard from that moment on to prepare myself in every way to be qualified for the rigorous challenges that higher education entails, and I also humbly seek share the gift of learning to inspire others on their own paths of discovery and self-improvement.

Since embarking on my educational journey, this realization has shaped my perspective: 
> *"The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know" (Albert Einstein)*

## Academic Work
### Publications
1. P. M. Pham and Q. C. Ta, “Stacked Long Short-Term Memory for Vietnamese Stock Market Returns Prediction”, IJASCFRT, vol. 13, no. 1, pp. 193–208, May 2022. [pdf](https://ijascfrtjournal.isrra.org/index.php/Applied_Sciences_Journal/article/view/1237/68)

> This independent project served as an my introductionto the field of data science, especially in the context of computational finance. Under the guidance and supervision of Dr. Ta, the Head of Artificial Intelligence Department at ThuyLoi University (VietNam), I explored the time-series data, which has long been recognized for their deviations from traditional econometric assumptions and requirement for specialized techniques and considerations. In the paper, I briefly discussed the overview of autoregressive methods (ARIMA, SARIMA) and proposed a Stacked  Long  Short-Term  Memory  (LSTM)  neural  network to predict the return of VN-Index, which demonstrated outperformance to statistical models in the prediction task.

2. Q. C. Ta and P. M. Pham, “Integrated Flow Shop and Vehicle Routing Problem Based on Tabu Search Algorithm”, IJC, vol. 43, no. 1, pp. 24–35, Apr. 2022 . [pdf](https://ijcjournal.org/index.php/InternationalJournalOfComputer/article/view/1927/714)

> This was Dr. Ta's project and my contribution was insignificant, but it was a pivotal catalyst, propelling me to the world of Operations Research. Flow shop scheduling and vehicle routing problem is a widely studied and prominent problem in operations research. We considered a m-machine flow shop scheduling problem with one vehicle available. The manufacturing workshop is a flow shop and there is only one vehicle available. Our objective was to minimize total tardiness while dealing with three interdependent problems: scheduling the jobs in the flow shop environment, batching the completed jobs, and routing the batches. We presented the resolution method based on Tabu search algorithm. Computational experiments were performed on random data sets and showed the efficiency of the methods.

### Theses
1. "Impact of Institutional Ownership on Earnings Management in Vietnamese Enterprises", thesis, 2021. [pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348406146_ANH_HUONG_CUA_SO_HUU_TO_CHUC_DEN_HOAT_DONG_QUAN_TRI_LOI_NHUAN_TAI_CAC_DOANH_NGHIEP_VIET_NAM#fullTextFileContent)

> This was my 104-page graduation thesis from Foreign Trade University, written in Vietnamese, specifically focusing on the field of Corporate Finance using statistical models. Under the guidance of Dr. Nguyen, it achieved the second highest grade among more than 300 students in my faculty. The thesis conducted a comprehensive review of previous studies on Earnings Management and Institutional Ownership and then centering on the analysis of panel data using three statistical models: Ordinary Least Squares Model, Fixed Effect Model, and Random Effect Model. The variables examined included leverage, market-to-book ratio, profitability, firm size, growth rate, company's age, market share, and institutional ownership. Earnings management was assessed using discretionary accruals estimated with the contemporary statistical estimation technique proposed by Kоthаri et al (2005).

### Projects

1. P.M. Pham, D. Maniscalco, C. Kenworthy, "Central Bank Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models", project report & poster, 2023.

> This industrial project was supervised by Prof. Hirsa and Morgan Stanley, which aimed at exploring the capacities of
LLMs to classify FOMC statements into hawkish, dovish, or neutral, then proposed the most efficient method to achieve 
this classification at both sentence and document levels. A new dataset (FOMC statements sentiments) and module have 
been created, leveraging several prompt engineering and parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques on recently released 
large language models. Our methods showed a consistently over 90% accuracy over the dataset.
