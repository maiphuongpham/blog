      <description>The Exponential Distribution and the Poisson Process The time $T$ required to repair a machine is an exponentially distributed random variable with mean $\frac{1}{2}$ (hours). (a) What is the probability that a repair time exceeds $\frac{1}{2}$ hour? (b) What is the probability that a repair takes at least $12\frac{1}{2} hours given that its duration exceeds 12 hours? See answer (a) Since $T \sim \text{Exp} (2)$, we have $P(T &amp;gt; \frac{1}{2}) = e^{-2{1}{2}} = e^{-1}$</description>

      <title>Theories of Growth</title>

      <description>Classical Growth Theory The conceptual foundations were formed by Thomas Malthus.
Malthusianism is the idea that population growth is potentially exponential while the growth of the food supply or other resources is linear, which eventually reduces living standards to the point of triggering a population die off.
Technological progress causes lrger population growth but had no impact on income per capita in the long run.
Neoclassical Growth Theory Neoclassical growth theory (Solow growth model) focus on estimating the economy&amp;rsquo;s long-term steady state growth rate.</description>

      <title>International Parity</title>

      <description>International parity is a framework for developing a view about futre exchange rate movements. Parity Relations the inter-relatioships that jointly determine long-run movements in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and inflation. Parity conditions show how expected inflation differentials ($\pi$), interest rate differentials ($i$), forward foreign exchange (Fx) rates ($F$), current spot Fx rates ($S$), and expected future spot foreign exchange rates would be linked in an ideal world ($S^{e}$).
Empirical studies showed that international parity conditions rarely hold in either the short or medium term (except covered interest rate parity).</description>

      <description>Assumptions Linearity Homoskedasticity Independence of errors Normality (of regression residuals) Independence of IVs Evaluating Model Fit Coefficient of Determination $R^{2}$ $$R^{2} = \frac{SSR}{SST} = \frac{\sum(\hat{Y_{i}} - \bar{Y})^{2}}{\sum(Y_{i} - \bar{Y})^{2}}$$
Adjusted $R^{2}$ Proposed by Mordecai Ezekiel, the adjusted $R^{2}$ is defined as
$$\bar{R}^{2} = 1 - \frac{SSE/ (n-k-1)}{SST/(n-1)} = 1 - \left[ \left( \frac{n-1}{n-k-1} \right) (1 - R^{2}) \right]$$
For $k \ge 1, \bar{R}^{2} &amp;lt; R^{2}$ if coefficient&amp;rsquo;s $|t - \text{stat}| &amp;gt; 1, \bar{R}^{2} \uparrow, \text{else } \bar{R}^{2} \downarrow$</description>

      <description>Supervised Machine Learning algorithms Penalized Regression (Dimention Reduction)
$$\min \sum_{i=1}^{n} \epsilon_{i}^{2} + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{k} |\hat{b_{k}}|$$
where $|\hat{b_{k}}|$ is the number of included features.
Support Vector Machine (Classification, Regression and Outlier Detection)
Maximize the probability of making a correct prediction by determining the (linear) boundary that is furthest from all observations.
Trade-off between a wider margin and a lower total error penalty.
K-nearest Neighbour (Classification (sometimes regression))
Classify new observations by finding similarities in the existing data.</description>

the notional principal amount start and end dates, value-date, trade-date, settlement dates, date scheduling (rolling) fixed rate (i.e. swap rate), sometimes swap spread floated interest rate index tenor day count conventions for interest calculations Receive floating
$$P_{IRS} = \frac{NA (\text{floating rate} - \text{fixed rate})(days / 360)}{1 + \text{floating rate}(days / 360)}$$</description>

      <description>One-factor short-rate models Short-rate model, describes the future evolution of interest rates by describing the future evolution of the short rate, usually written $r_{t}$
The short rate is the (continuously compounded, annualized) interest rate at which an entity can borrow money for an infinitesimally short period of time from time $t$
Following are the one-factor models, where a single stochastic factor - the short rate - determines the future evolution of all interest rates.</description>

      <description>Black and Scholes assumed: A continuously-compounded interest rate of $r$. Geometric Brownian motion dynamics for the stock price, $S_{t}$, so that $$S_{t} = S_{0} e^{(\mu - \sigma^{2}/2)t + \sigma W_{t}}$$ where $W_{t}$ is a standard Brownian motion. The stock pays a dividend yield of $c$. Continuous trading with no transactions costs and short-selling allowed. Black-Scholes formula: $$C_{0} = S_{0} e^{-cT}N(d_{1}) - K e^{-rT}N(d_{2})$$ where $$d_{1} = \frac{\ln(S_{0}/K) + (r - c + \sigma^{2}/2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}$$ $$d_{2} = d_{1} - \sigma \sqrt{T}$$</description>

      <description>Mundell-Fleming Model Developed in early 1960s, the Mundell-Fleming model evaluates the short-term impact of monetary and fiscal policies on interest rates - and consequently on exchange rates. The model assumes that there is sufficient slack in the economy to handle changes in aggregate demand, and that inflation is not a concern.
Flexible Exchange Rate Regimes Rates are determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange markets. High mobility of capital: international capital flows are relatively unrestricted.</description>

      <description>Duration the measure of a bond&amp;rsquo;s interest rate risk or sensitivity of a bond&amp;rsquo;s full price to a change in its yield.
Macaulay Duration Introduced by Frederick Macaulay (1938), is the weighted average number of years until each of the bond&amp;rsquo;s promised cash flow is to be paid, where the weights are the present values of each cash flow as a percentage of the bond&amp;rsquo;s full value.
Macaulay Duration $D$ is defined as</description>
